# Silo Computations Details
This is a mobile app. It is developed to solve computational problems encountered in Grain Silos. The app is to be presented at the training program organised for silo managers; coming up in 2 weeks time in the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Strategic Grain Reserve Department.

The app solves the 4 major problems in silo management, namely:
•	Random sampling of consignment of grain bags;
•	Calculation of relative humidity and equilibrium moisture content of grain;
•	Calculation for selection of aeration fans; and 
•	Calculations for sustainable pesticide applications.

These are computations with complex logics. The web page shows steps including data tables used for fans selection. Other data tables for computing relative humidity and moisture content are embedded in SiloCom.java.
